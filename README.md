# On-Hold

This repository started as a way for me to keep track of the different exercises or mini-projects I found on the internet while learning how to be a developer. I figured out that the best way to learn is by solving problems and implementing what I learned in my own projects (crazy, I know). However, this idea turned out to be a burden and the amount of file creation and copying wasn't worth the time.

### ...But, thats where a new project can start!

Now that I have my own problem and there is this thing called machine learning, I may as well start learning Python and the technology that pretty much started a ~~war~~ competition to automate the process of getting algorithm/exercise answers from different webpages and committing them to this repository.

However, for now, this is just a distant project. No one knows what the uncertain future holds. For you who clicked on a Spanish title to get an English description, te deseo la mejor de las suertes.
